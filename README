# Guide To CSharp Design Patterns
## Behavioral patterns


Blackboard	
Artificial intelligence pattern for combining disparate sources of data (see blackboard system)	

Chain of responsibility	
Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.	

Command	
Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for the parameterization of clients with different requests, and the queuing or logging of requests. It also allows for the support of undoable operations.	

Interpreter	
Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.	

Iterator	
Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.	

Mediator	
Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it allows their interaction to vary independently.	

Memento	
Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state allowing the object to be restored to this state later.	
Null object	Avoid null references by providing a default object.	

Observer or Publish/subscribe	
Define a one-to-many dependency between objects where a state change in one object results in all its dependents being notified and updated automatically.	Yes	Yes	N/A

Servant	
Define common functionality for a group of classes.	

Specification	
Recombinable business logic in a Boolean fashion.	

State	
Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.	

Strategy	
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.	Yes	Yes	N/A

Template method	
Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.	Yes	Yes	N/A

Visitor	
Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets a new operation be defined without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.	Yes	No	N/A


## Creational patterns
===================
Abstract factory	
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.	

Builder	            
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.	

Factory method	    
Define an interface for creating a single object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses (dependency injection).	

Lazy initialization	
Tactic of delaying the creation of an object, the calculation of a value, or some other expensive process until the first time it is needed. This pattern appears in the GoF catalog as "virtual proxy", an implementation strategy for the Proxy pattern.	

Multiton	        
Ensure a class has only named instances, and provide a global point of access to them.	

Object pool	        
Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use. Can be considered a generalisation of connection pool and thread pool patterns.	

Prototype	        
Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects from the 'skeleton' of an existing object, thus boosting performance and keeping memory footprints to a minimum.	

Resource acquisition is initialization	
Ensure that resources are properly released by tying them to the lifespan of suitable objects.	

Singleton	        
Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.


## Structural patterns
===================

Adapter or Wrapper or Translator	
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. An adapter lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. The enterprise integration pattern equivalent is the translator.	

Bridge	
Decouple an abstraction from its implementation allowing the two to vary independently.	

Composite	
Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

Decorator	
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically keeping the same interface. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.	

Extension object	
Adding functionality to a hierarchy without changing the hierarchy.	

Facade	
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.	

Flyweight	
Use sharing to support large numbers of similar objects efficiently.	

Front controller	
The pattern relates to the design of Web applications. It provides a centralized entry point for handling requests.	

Marker	
Empty interface to associate metadata with a class.	

Module	
Group several related elements, such as classes, singletons, methods, globally used, into a single conceptual entity.	

Proxy	
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.	

Twin 	
Twin allows modeling of multiple inheritance in programming languages that do not support this feature.
